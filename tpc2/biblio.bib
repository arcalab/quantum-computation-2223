  abstract = {Applications of modal logics are abundant in computer science, and a large number of structurally different modal logics have been successfully employed in a diverse spectrum of application contexts. Coalgebraic semantics, on the other hand,  provides  a uniform and encompassing view on the large variety of specific logics used in particular domains.  The coalgebraic
approach is generic and compositional: tools and
techniques simultaneously apply to a large class of application
areas and can moreover be combined in a modular way.
In particular, this facilitates a pick-and-choose approach to domain
specific formalisms, applicable across the entire scope of
application areas, leading to generic software tools that are easier to design, to implement, and to maintain.
This paper substantiates the authors' firm belief that the systematic exploitation of this coalgebraic nature will not only have impact on
the field of modal logic itself but also
lead to significant progress in a number
of areas within computer science, such as knowledge representation
and concurrency/mobility.

  abstract  = {
    Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems
    and are defined as dynamical systems with interacting
    discrete transitions and continuous evolutions along
    differential equations. With the goal of developing a
    theoretical and practical foundation for deductive
    verification of hybrid systems, we introduce a dynamic
    logic for hybrid programs, which is a program notation
    for hybrid systems. As a verification technique that is
    suitable for automation, we introduce a free variable
    proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued
    free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier
    elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic. The
    calculus is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties
    of hybrid programs to properties of their parts. Our
    main result proves that this calculus axiomatises the
    transition behaviour of hybrid systems completely
    relative to differential equations. In a case study
    with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train
    Control System, we further show that our calculus is
    well-suited for verifying realistic hybrid systems with
    parametric system dynamics.

    Hybrid systems are a fusion of continuous dynamical
    systems and discrete dynamical systems. They freely
    combine dynamical features from both worlds. For that
    reason, it has often been claimed that hybrid systems
    are more challenging than continuous dynamical systems
    and than discrete systems. We now show that,
    proof-theoretically, this is not the case. We present a
    complete proof-theoretical alignment that interreduces
    the discrete dynamics and the continuous dynamics of
    hybrid systems. We give a sound and complete
    axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to continuous
    dynamical systems and a sound and complete
    axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to discrete
    dynamical systems. Thanks to our axiomatization,
    proving properties of hybrid systems is exactly the
    same as proving properties of continuous dynamical
    systems and again, exactly the same as proving
    properties of discrete dynamical systems. This
    fundamental cornerstone sheds light on the nature of
    hybridness and enables flexible and provably perfect
    combinations of discrete reasoning with continuous
    reasoning that lift to all aspects of hybrid systems
    and their fragments.}

    Aircraft collision avoidance maneuvers are important
    and complex applications. Curved flight exhibits
    nontrivial continuous behavior. In combination with the
    control choices during air traffic maneuvers, this
    yields hybrid systems with challenging interactions of
    discrete and continuous dynamics. As a case study
    illustrating the use of a new proof assistant for a
    logic for nonlinear hybrid systems, we analyze
    collision freedom of roundabout maneuvers in air
    traffic control, where appropriate curved flight, good
    timing, and compatible maneuvering are crucial for
    guaranteeing safe spatial separation of aircraft
    throughout their flight. We show that formal
    verification of hybrid systems can scale to curved
    flight maneuvers required in aircraft control
    applications. We introduce a fully flyable variant of
    the roundabout collision avoidance maneuver and verify
    safety properties by compositional verification.}

By using probabilistic transition systems as the underlying semantic model, we show how a testing algorithm can distinguish, with a probability arbitrarily close to one, between processes that are not bisimulation equivalent. We also show a similar result (in a slightly stronger form) for a new process relation called 23-bisimulation‚Äîwhich lies strictly between that of simulation and bisimulation. Finally, the ultimately strength of the testing language is shown to identify a new process relation called probabilistic bisimulation‚Äîwhich is strictly stronger than bisimulation. "

The logics are studied within the abstract framework of coalgebraic modal logic, which can be instantiated with arbitrary endofunctors on the category of sets. This is achieved through the use of predicate liftings, which generalise atomic propositions and modal operators from Kripke models to arbitrary coalgebras. Predicate liftings also allow us to use induction along the terminal sequence of the underlying endofunctor as a proof principle. This induction principle is systematically exploited to establish soundness, completeness and decidability of the logics. We believe that this induction principle also opens new ways for reasoning about modal logics: Our proof of completeness does not rely on a canonical model construction, and the proof of the finite model property does not use filtrations.
