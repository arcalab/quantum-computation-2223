To design the blackbox, we do not need to know the solution to the problem in advance: it suffices to design a blackbox that checks if the assignment results in $f$ evaluates to True or False. It turns out that we can design such a blackbox efficiently (in fact, any NP-complete problem has the property that although finding the solution is difficult, checking the solution is easy). \n",
